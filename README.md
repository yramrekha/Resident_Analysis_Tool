**Introduction**

In the dynamic landscape of retirement homes, our commitment to excellence has driven us to undertake a groundbreaking project aimed at enhancing the quality of life for our residents. The core motivation behind this endeavour is rooted in a desire to not only understand the current state of retirement living but also to position our company at the forefront of innovation and customer satisfaction by providing unparalleled services and amenities to our residents.

**Project Motivation**

The driving force behind this project lies in our recognition of the evolving needs and expectations of seniors seeking a comfortable and enriching retirement experience. To better understand our standing among competitors and identify areas for improvement, we developed a sophisticated analysis tool. This tool, designed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of competing retirement homes, allows us to gather insights directly from the residents themselves.

**Data Collection Methodology**

Our approach involved reaching out to a diverse pool of seniors at various social communities, where residents from different retirement homes congregate for social activities. With a target of gathering feedback from 10,000 residents (used a sample of 1000 for this project), we deployed an online survey crafted in HTML and CSS. The survey covered essential aspects such as the company they are currently residing with, their age group, and their satisfaction ratings (on a scale of 1-5) for food, entertainment, amenities, staff, and cleanliness. To encourage participation, respondents were offered entry into a draw upon completing the survey. Additional inquiries included their likelihood to recommend their current retirement home to a friend and their plans for relocation in the near future.

**Data Processing and Analysis**

Following the extensive data collection, the responses were stored in a CSV file and meticulously cleaned using Python scripts to ensure accuracy and completeness. Subsequently, the data underwent thorough analysis, and compelling visualizations, including charts and pies, were generated using Python. This comprehensive report served as a valuable resource for our company, guiding operational and marketing decisions based on real, actionable insights. All the charts generated are saved under the visualizations folder. 

**Technological Integration**

To streamline the reporting process and enhance accessibility, a POWER BI report was developed. This interactive report not only facilitated data-driven decision-making for internal stakeholders but also served as a powerful tool during shareholder meetings. The integration of technology not only allowed for more efficient analysis but also ensured that decision-makers had a comprehensive and visually engaging overview of the findings.

**Conclusion**

This project represents a pivotal step towards redefining the retirement living experience. By leveraging cutting-edge tools and methodologies, we aim to not only meet but exceed the expectations of our residents. The insights gained from this analysis will not only inform our operational strategies but will also guide our marketing efforts to ensure that our facilities stand out in an increasingly competitive landscape.






**Data Confidentiality Statement:**

For confidentiality purposes, the original dataset utilized in this project has not been publicly released. Instead, a regenerated dataset closely resembling the original sample has been created. This regeneration was achieved through the design of a custom Python script, ensuring privacy and security while maintaining the integrity of our analysis. The attached file serves as an example generated by this script.


Upcoming Improvements: Survey Form Update, New tools in Analyzing data, Power BI Reports/Visualizations
